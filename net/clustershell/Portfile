description             Scalable cluster administration Python framework
long_description        ClusterShell is an event-driven open source Python \
                        library, designed to run local or distant commands in \
                        parallel on server farms or on large Linux clusters. \
                        It will take care of common issues encountered on HPC \
                        clusters, such as operating on groups of nodes, \
                        running distributed commands using optimized execution \
                        algorithms, as well as gathering results and merging \
                        identical outputs, or retrieving return codes. \
                        ClusterShell takes advantage of existing remote shell \
                        facilities already installed on your systems, like SSH.
